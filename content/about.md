Curious and passionate about new technologies, I am particularly interested in  Cloud technology (virtualization, container, object storage) and automation/deployment.
<p>
<br>
</p>
My past experiences allowed me to gain expertise in different technologies like AIX, VMware, Storage, Linux (RedHat, Debian, Ubuntu) and build a solid background of sys admin.  
<p>
<br>
</p>
Over the past 5 years, I embraced the DevOps methodology and use it on cutting edge technologies, container, cloud with an emphasis on automation. Software development became a key skill in this new world, so I focus my learnings in this area and use for my to day to day work  languages like Go and Python.
<p>

My goal is to provide the highest level of service with innovative responses to the daily challenges I'm facing on.
